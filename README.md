# CheckIOAnswers

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/phermens/testing/_apis/build/status/PHeonix25.CheckiOAnswers?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/phermens/testing/_build/latest?definitionId=4?branchName=master)

CheckIOAnswers is a Python CLI application generated from https://github.com/xuanluong/cookiecutter-python-cli that will host my answers to the CheckiO Python challenges (https://py.checkio.org/)

This is just a simple app that's helping me to learn about Python, how applications are structured/developed/built/packaged/published, etc.

This application is developed in VS2017, so that's why you'll see all the *.pysln files. 
Feel free to contribute a PR with your editor of choice if you're using something different?
